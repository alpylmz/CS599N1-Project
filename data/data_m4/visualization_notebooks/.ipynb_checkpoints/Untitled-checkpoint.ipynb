Our goal value we calculated to be about 97 ms for fwddyn previously, but let's switch to using the same execution for both the lineprof and  kerprof results, so that even if there are random movements in times these should be the same random movements captured by both tools. Checking the line_prof results for this particular example, we get: 1,743.24 ms, and deleting the model loading and profiler handling itself, we reach 96.83 ms. It is not clear whether all the calls that are being counted are actually in any way related to the profiled functions, but the main bottleneck solver.solve() definitely is related, and so at the very least 93.01 ms are spent on related steps. That doesn't mean that the kernprof values should add to exactly that value, but it should hopefully be fairly close, and certainly shouldn't exceed the 96.83 ms value. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make that work, we should start with known independant values. SolverFDDP::solve takes 93 milliseconds, which is more than any other function; this means that no other function can be its parent so it must be a unique measurement. From there, we have somewhere between 0 and 4 more milliseconds, meaning that all the other large time cost functions must be children of solve, since they can't fit in the correct time frame otherwise. In fact, any function that takes more than 3.8 ms total must be a child of solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also observe that SolverDDP::calcDiff takes just a few milliseconds longer than ShootingProblem::calcDiff, implying that the former is relying on the latter for most of the computation in that step; they are most likely essentially the same function, with perhaps a couple fast extra compute steps in SolverDDP. Similarly, the tryStep runs for just 0.04 milliseconds longer than the forwardPass step, meaning it is functionally just calling the forwardPass phase directly, with a conditional try to gaurd against errors.\n",
    "The same logic applies to combinations of children functions too: the SolverDDP::computeDirection step is simply too large not to have children, and notably the two preceeding large steps (backwardPass and calcDiff) sum to 74.08 ms, just 0.05 ms less than the runtime of computeDirection. Finally, the sum of the tryStep and computeDirection step gets us to 91.97 ms, just barely a millisecond off from the total, so these are almost certainly the 2 main direct children of solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of time remaining for direct children isn't large enough for the SolverDDP::computeGains step, so it must be the child of one of these two. Since computeGains ran 1600 times, it makes sense that it may have been run 100 times for each iteration of computeDirection, which ran 16 times. That said, there isn't enough room under computeDirection for it either, so it must be an even lower level child. Similar reasoning for iterations would lead us to believe that the quadratic problems and value function approximations are also happening somewhere in computeDirection. It would also make sense to say that the quadratic problems are likely all solved in the same loop, However all of them together can't fit inside the computeGains loop that already holds the Quu_inv and Quu_inv_Qux calculations. What's more, the largest quadratic solve takes 2.59 ms, which is too large to fit in computeGains or its children. They are also too large as a group to fit in SolverDDP::calcDiff, so they must go in the backwardPass instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, ShootingProblem::calc is only called once, so if it were inside any of the child loops it would have to be hidden behind conditionals somehow. The more likely explanation in this case is that it is either a direct child of solve, or not a child of any function. As mentioned earlier, only one millisecond isn't already accounted for in the body of solve, and this is most likely it. This brings the total accounted for time in the solve function up to 92.88, just 0.12 ms from the 93 ms run time of the function.\n",

My best understanding is that calc and calcDiff are called in functions that are defined in a different namespace (ie. SolverDDP). Because they are in this namespace, they have access to the functions defined in that namespace, which includes ShootingProblem::calc and ShootingProblem::calcDiff because SolverDDP inherits from solver-base, which takes a shooting probem problem formulation for initiaization, on which the calc and calcDiff functions are declared. However even there they aren't well defined, and it is unclear to me where the definition lies. That said, calc is called only three times in dpp.cpp, and 2 of those are in the SolverDDP::forwardPass function, which is not used in this case in favor of SolverFDDP's version. The only remaining option is that it is being called from the 3rd call, which is in the SolverDDP::calcDiff function. This is also where the only viable call to calcDiff is.\n",

    "I added relevant functions, and removed entries that were measuring the function call directly where the function being called lay in another namespace, file, or class (ie. delete SolverIntro::computeDirection in favor of SolverDDP::computeDirection. Some items, like regularization, hadn't had their equivalent functions recorded for fwddyn, so I deleted them. This seems fine since they were small enough to be inconsiquential, but we should do a better job measuring them in the future. I think both versions use SolverDDP::increaseRegularization, but someone would need to verify this. Similarly, expectedImprovement seems to be be used in both cases as well, and is defined in fddp.cpp. In this case though, it is called in 2 places in SolvereIntro.solve, and is measured seperately as two different items for each. The profiler should be moved too the function definition in fddp.cpp. I also deleted loop2 as it doesn't correspond to anything we care about at this point. calcDerivatives was deleted because it measures something very similar to tryStep, and tryStep has a direct equivalent in fwddyn already so it is better for comparison. setCandidate should be recorded, but it isn't recorded for fwddyn, so deleted. Finally I deleted the callbacks function as well, since this is an identical cost for fwddyn that wasn't measured on that side, though it should be measured in future.\n",

    "Beyond deletions, it seems SolverIntro::calcDiff actually adds onto SolverFDDP::calcDiff and calls it directly, so that should certainly be part of the measured values here. SolverFDDP happens to rely on SolverDDP for  calcDiff, so SolverDDP::calcDiff is represented here (and consequently ShootingProblem::calc and calcDiff), but that is mainly incidental. Actually n/m that is wrong, SolverFDDP inherits from DDP, and doesn't define it's own calcDiff or computeGains, so both of these go straight to SolverDDP, although meaningful additions are made in intro.cpp so I would advise keeping the extra profiling there in this case.\n",
